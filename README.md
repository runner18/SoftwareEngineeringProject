# SoftwareEngineeringProject
The objective of this project is to create a software system that will show and calculate the statistics of various softball teams. The program will accept manually input values as well as be able to read data from an external source, such as an API, locally stored file, or database. From there, the statistics manager will utilize the provided information for various people on the teamâ€™s roster (i.e. coach, hitter, and pitcher) to calculate the statistics of an overall team, individual player. The statistics manager will then pass off the data to the front end of the project, which would contain the user interface. The user interface will allow the user to easily modify the data entry and calculate the data efficiently.

# Using the Program
This program has multiple features to assist with given softball data.

## Table Display
The data is fetched and dispalyed in a table as shown below. The table can then be operated by a few mouse actions. First, a user can select a row of data by left-clicking on any element within the table.

## Insert Data
Once the interface has been expanded, the user can then select the team that they would like to insert a new player into. From there, the user can then input the player name and the various statistics. After this occurs, the user will then put in all of the pitcher statistics and the data will be entered successfully into the database.
